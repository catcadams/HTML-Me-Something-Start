      <h1>My 2023 Summer Trip to Michigan</h1>
      <h2>
        Last summer, I visited the western side of Michigan with my boyfriend.
        We went to a bunch of different towns while we were there to really
        experience it all. The beaches are beautiful, there are fun lighthouses,
        great coffee shops, and a wide variety of breweries!

          <p>
            After an awful drive through pouring down rain, we made it to our
            first location of the week: Yankee Springs State Park. We were at a
            campsite very close to Gun Lake, one of the nine lakes located
            within the park boundaries, and got to watch a beautiful sunset over
            the lake!

            In Holland, we went to 3 different breweries: New Holland Brewing,
            Our Brewing Company, and Big Lake Brewing. We also visited our first
            beach and lighthouse of the week there! It was too cold to get in
            the water, but it made for a beautiful walk.

          <p>
            Saugatuck and Douglas are very close to each other, so it's easy to
            tour the two at the same time. We went up Mount Baldhead in
            Saugatuck, which is a large dune, then came down the other side to
            our second beach of the trip, Oval Beach. Before leaving the area,
            we made sure to swing by the local brewery, Saugutuck Brewing CO!

            We drove up to Grand Haven to check out another beach and
            lighthouse; this was a short visit, but we were able to grab a drink
            at Odd Side Brewery before heading out.

          <p>
            Grand Rapids was one of my favorite stops; it reminds me of St.
            Louis in the way that it's a decent sized city but has a small town
            feel to it. In the suburbs of Grand Rapids, there is a gorgeous park
            called the Frederik Meijer Gardens &amp; Sculpter Park; the park
            holds so many fascinating works of art, several different
            horticultural displays, a beautiful Japanese garden, and even a
            carnivorous plant house! This place is absolutely worth a visit. Of
            course, we made sure to check out a couple of breweries while we
            were in Grand Rapids: Founder's, Jolly Pumpkin, and (my favorite)
            Brewery Vivant.

          <p>
            We were only in Fennville for an evening, grabbing a delicious
            dinner at Salt of the Earth. It was the best meal we had the entire
            week and I hope that I get to go back there someday soon!

          <p>
            I specifically wanted to go to South Haven to attend the National
            Blueberry Festival; it was happening over the course of 3 days and
            we were only able to attend the first day, but it was a really fun
            experience. It extended over the boardwalk down to the beach and
            lighthouse so we got to walk the beach, check out the farmer's
            market they hosted, bought some blueberries, blueberry jam, and
            blueberry bbq sauce. The only thing we missed out on was the
            blueberry pancake breakfast. We also went to a super cute, alien
            themed coffee shop called The Flying Saucer and made sure to try a
            local brewery, which was called Three Blondes Brewery.

            Kalamazoo felt like an extra special visit as that is where my
            boyfriend went to college and he hadn't been back since his school
            days. We got to walk around the town and check out two really cool
            local breweries, Bell's Brewery, one of the first craft breweries,
            and One Well, an arcade brewery. We ended our trip to Michigan
            playing pinball and plotting out when we would be able to come back!
