      <h1>My 2023 Summer Trip to Michigan</h1>
      <h2>
        Last summer, I visited the western side of Michigan with my boyfriend.
        We went to a bunch of different towns while we were there to really
        experience it all. The beaches are beautiful, there are fun lighthouses,
        great coffee shops, and a wide variety of breweries!
      </h2>
      <h3>Here are all the towns we visited:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Yankee Springs State Park</li>
        <li>Holland</li>
        <li>Saugatuck and Douglas</li>
        <li>Grand Haven</li>

          <h3>Yankee Springs State Park</h3>
          <p>
            After an awful drive through pouring down rain, we made it to our
            first location of the week: Yankee Springs State Park. We were at a
            campsite very close to Gun Lake, one of the nine lakes located
            within the park boundaries, and got to watch a beautiful sunset over
            the lake!

            We were only in Fennville for an evening, grabbing a delicious
            dinner at Salt of the Earth. It was the best meal we had the entire
            week and I hope that I get to go back there someday soon!

            there.
